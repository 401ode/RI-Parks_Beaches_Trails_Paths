  Description:
    Abstract: Point locations depicting ballfields, playgrounds, basketball & tennis courts, beaches, swimming pools, etc with attribution for facility name, location, ownership, and availability and number of recreational resources on site.
    Purpose: These vector point data are collected and maintained to track the availability of outdoor recreational facilities maintained by State & Local Government for public use.
    Supplemental_Information: These data were originally put together to comply with federal rules that required states to submit a State Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plan (SCORP) update every 5 years (formerly every ten years) so that state governments would remain eligible for federal funds for facility acquisition and development.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report: These data were manualy reviewed to remove those locations in which recreation facilities were open to the public, but not owned by the public (required a fee to enter, such as a driving range or marina). Locations that were also included in state and local conservation (open space) datasets were also removed. Remaining facilities were then verified using local recreation department websites and 2011 aerial imagery for the state of Rhode Island.
  Logical_Consistency_Report: Data manually reviewed to ensure consistency with local recreation facilities.
  Completeness_Report: These data are considered complete as determined by the State of Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management GIS Specialist (see Point of Contat).
  Lineage:
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        The original polygon dataset was modified every 5-10 years to comply with federal rules that required states to submit a State Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plan (SCORP) update on a regular basis so that state governments would remain eligible for federal funds for facility acquisition and development.
        The current version of this SCORP dataset has evolved over the years from the 1990 version. Once state and local openspace (conservation) layers were created (see RIGIS layers StaCons14 and LocCons14 under the Environment and Conservation section), there was no need to continue the SCORP layer as polygon data.  So the centroids were taken from each polygon to create this new point-based layer. Points that were covered by a state or local open space (conservation) polygon layer were deleted. These were then reviewed to ensure that they did indeed represent some form of public outdoor recreational facility (beach, tennis court, playground, etc.).  Golf courses, driving ranges, marinas and other private or fee based outdoor activities were also eliminated as they are open to, but not owned by the public.
        Recently, these data were the compared to the data gleaned from local recreation department webpages and what can be seen in the 2011 aerial imagery to verify types of facilities and amenities.
